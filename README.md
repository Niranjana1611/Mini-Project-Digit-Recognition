# Mini-Project-Digit-Recognition

Hand written Digit recognition using Artificial Intelligence. This helps in the recognition of the digit that is written on the canvas. Libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, OpenCV were used. Datasets were collected from Kaggle. MINIST Datasets were used. Activation functions like relu, softmax were used for Convolution Neural Network
